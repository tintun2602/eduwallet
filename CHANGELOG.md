## [v1.1.0] - 2024-10-21 - Environment Management & Security Overhaul

### **Centralized Environment Management**

**Problem Solved:** Multiple components had inconsistent environment configurations, leading to contract address mismatches and configuration drift.

**Changes Made:**

- **Created root `.env` file** as single source of truth for all environment variables
- **Set up symlinks** from all components (`cli/`, `sdk/`, `university-portal/`) to root `.env`
- **Unified contract address** across all components: `0x6D411e0A54382eD43F02410Ce1c7a7c122afA6E1`
- **Centralized configuration** for blockchain network, IPFS storage, and university settings

**Files Modified:**

- `/.env` (new) - Central environment configuration
- `/cli/.env` → symlink to `/.env`
- `/sdk/.env` → symlink to `/.env`
- `/university-portal/.env` → symlink to `/.env`

**Benefits:**

- Single file to manage all environment variables
- No more configuration inconsistencies
- Easy contract address updates across all components
- Simplified deployment and maintenance

---

### **Security Improvements**

**Problem Solved:** Hardcoded private keys and sensitive data exposed in source code.

**Changes Made:**

- **Removed hardcoded private keys** from university portal service
- **Made environment variables required** with helpful error messages
- **Created `.env.example` template** for proper configuration setup
- **Added security warnings** for missing environment variables

**Files Modified:**

- `university-portal/src/services/blockchainService.ts`
- `university-portal/.env.example` (new)

**Security Enhancements:**

- Private keys now must be provided via environment variables
- Clear error messages guide users to proper configuration
- No sensitive data committed to version control
- Template file shows required configuration structure

---

### **Smart Contract Integration Fixes**

**Problem Solved:** CLI was failing with "could not decode result data" errors due to contract address mismatches.

**Changes Made:**

- **Fresh contract deployment** with clean state
- **Synchronized contract addresses** across all components
- **Fixed SDK exports** to properly expose `blockchainConfig`
- **Updated CLI to use SDK configuration** instead of hardcoded values

**Files Modified:**

- `sdk/src/index.ts` - Added `blockchainConfig` export
- `cli/src/interact.ts` - Use SDK's contract address
- `browser-extension/src/utils/conf.ts` - Updated contract address

**Technical Details:**

- Deployed fresh contracts to avoid stale state
- All components now connect to same contract instance
- Proper role management (UNIVERSITY_ROLE) working correctly
- Student registration and data retrieval functioning properly

---

### **Code Cleanup & Type Safety**

**Problem Solved:** TypeScript compilation errors and unused code causing build issues.

**Changes Made:**

- **Removed unused imports** (`Navigate`, `StudentModel`, `Alert`)
- **Fixed TypeScript type errors** with proper interfaces and type guards
- **Removed hardcoded student addresses** from university portal
- **Improved error handling** with proper fallbacks

**Files Modified:**

- `browser-extension/src/components/PrivateRoute.tsx`
- `browser-extension/src/pages/CredentialPageComponent.tsx`
- `browser-extension/src/pages/ImportPageComponent.tsx`
- `university-portal/src/pages/StudentDetailPage.tsx`

**Type Safety Improvements:**

- Defined specific interfaces for different credential types
- Added type guards for safe property access
- Removed unused variables and imports
- Better error handling without fallback dummy data

---

### **UI/UX Improvements**

**Problem Solved:** Footer overlapping content and oversized UI elements for browser extension.

**Changes Made:**

- **Fixed footer overlap** with dynamic padding based on footer visibility
- **Optimized content spacing** for browser extension constraints
- **Reduced font sizes and margins** for more compact layout
- **Improved footer grid layout** (2 rows × 3 items)

**Files Modified:**

- `browser-extension/src/App.css`
- `browser-extension/src/index.css`
- `browser-extension/src/components/LayoutComponent.tsx`
- `browser-extension/src/components/FooterComponent.tsx`
- `browser-extension/src/styles/FooterStyle.css`

**UI Enhancements:**

- Content no longer overlaps with fixed footer
- More compact design suitable for browser extension
- Better visual hierarchy with adjusted spacing
- Responsive footer layout with proper grid structure

---

## **Testing & Verification**

### **CLI Functionality Test Results**

```
Contract connection successful
University subscription working
Student registration working
Student data retrieval working
All operations completing without errors
```

### **Environment Management Test Results**

```
All components reading from centralized .env
Symlinks functioning correctly
Contract address consistency verified
Build processes working with new configuration
```

---

## **Migration Guide**

### **For Developers:**

1. **Environment Setup:**

```bash
   # All components now use root .env file
   # No need to maintain separate .env files
   # Update only the root .env for changes
```

2. **Contract Address Updates:**

   ```bash
   # Single command updates all components
   sed -i '' 's/REGISTER_ADDRESS=0x.*/REGISTER_ADDRESS=0xNEW_ADDRESS/' .env
   ```

3. **New Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Add to root .env file
   echo "NEW_VARIABLE=value" >> .env
   ```

### **For Deployment:**

1. **Fresh Contract Deployment:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   # Update REGISTER_ADDRESS in root .env
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Copy .env.example to .env and fill in values
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with actual values
   ```
